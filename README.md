------- Must level -----------
All features are done. I am not sure modify the background-color by addind additional CSS is what you attend by meaning 'without using backend' but it seems on my opinion the best solution since it modifies indirectly the theme.


------- Beginner level ---------------
All features are done. I stil have some questions and I appreciated Wordpress guidelines, documentation and examples.
Everything is not perfect at all but I tried to understand the maximum amount of stuff to do this correclty.
I used a plugin to create the registration form, which I hope is not forbiden.

------- How to deploy the live site ----------------
Install XAMPP or other similar software. Replace its htdocs directory by this one. I suggested to replace the mysql directory with mine before seeing to see export db in .sql, I assume you know how to create the db for Wordpress. Start XAMPP (Appach and MYSQL server and the site should be running.

Rendering Instructions:
- I did not use any domain name because I ran my website on XAMPP.
- Installed plugins:
	- Fake Pay for Woocommerce
	- User Registration
	- Variation swatches for WooCommerce
	- WooCommerce
	- Display Message for client (own plugin)

- Accces for wp backend:
ID: root
mdp: SU35xTtx5

- I didn't do the expert level
